[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is a month-long online festival which takes place every year in October. It is sponsored by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and aims to encourage people to get involved in open source projects.

## How to get involved
Through October, we at Redis are creating a number of GitHub issues for folks who want to contribute to our documentation and demo apps. [View our list of current open issues](https://github.com/search?q=%23hacktoberfest+user%3Aredislabs-training+user%3Aredis+user%3Aredis-developer+user%3ANodeRedis+label%3Ahacktoberfest&state=open&type=Issues).

### Get a GitHub account and Hacktoberfest account
You'll need a GitHub account to contribute to our repos. Sign up for free at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).

You'll also need to register with Hacktoberfest using your GitHub account if you want to be in with a chance of earning swag from DigitalOcean. **Please note that Redis is not involved in allocating or sending swag.**

### Finding and working on an issue
1. [Look for a suitable issue on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%23hacktoberfest+user%3Aredislabs-training+user%3Aredis+user%3Aredis-developer+user%3ANodeRedis+label%3Ahacktoberfest&state=open&type=Issues). Where possible, we have tagged them according to the skillset and level of experience required.

2. Read the guidance notes on each issue carefully so you know what's expected of you.

3. Add a comment in the issue stating that you're working on it. **To be fair to other contributors, only claim one issue at a time.**

4. **Open a pull request within two calendar days:**

- This is to give more people a fair chance at finding an unclaimed issue.
- Make sure you reference the issue number in your pull request so that it shows on the issue's page.
- If you're a member of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/redis), include your Discord handle and we will bestow the **Hacktoberfest 2022** role upon you.

When you do this, your pull request will then be automatically referenced in the issue:

- If you don't submit a pull request within two calendar days, we will make the issue available to other contributors.

5. We will review your pull request. If it's suitable, we'll merge it and add the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label. **If we feel that further work is required, we'll comment as part of our review.**
