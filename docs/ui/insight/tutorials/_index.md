RedisInsight allows you to browse, filter, and visualize key-value Redis data structures. It supports CRUD operation for lists, hashes, strings, sets, sorted sets, and so on. You can take advantage of built-in examples in Workbench to learn about the data structures. We'll guide you through one of those examples here and show you other practical ways to use RedisInsight with your databases.
