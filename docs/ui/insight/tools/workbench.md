**Workbench** is an advanced command-line interface that lets you run commands against your Redis or Redis Stack database. It:

* Supports auto-complete and syntax highlighting for Redis commands.
* Provides data visualizations for many Redis and Redis Stack capabilities, such as search capability, graph and time series, and `CLIENT LIST` command.
  <img src="../../images/Workbench_TimeSeries.png">
* Allows you to extend the core functionality by building your own data visualizations. For more information, see [Plugins](/docs/ui/insight/plugins).

Use built-in interactive guides and tutorials to discover and learn Redis and Redis Stack features and capabilities.

Share your Redis expertise with your team and the wider community by building custom RedisInsight tutorials. Use our [instructions](https://github.com/RedisInsight/Tutorials) to describe your implementations of Redis for other users to follow and interact with in the context of a connected Redis database.
Let the community discover your content by labeling your GitHub repository [redis-tutorials](https://github.com/topics/redis-tutorials).
