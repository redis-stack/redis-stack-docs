Create and manage streams by adding, removing, and filtering entries per timestamp. To see and work with new entries, enable and customize the automatic refresh rate.

View and manage the list of consumer groups. See existing consumers in a given consumer name as well as the last messages delivered to them. Inspect the list of pending messages, explicitly acknowledge the processed items, or claim unprocessed messages via RedisInsight.
