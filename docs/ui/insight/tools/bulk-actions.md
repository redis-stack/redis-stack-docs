With bulk actions, you can delete multiple keys with the same type, the same key name pattern, or both in bulk.

To delete multiple keys in bulk:

 1. In the List or Tree view, filter by key type or key name.
 
 1. Select **Bulk Actions** to display the keys and the expected number of keys to be deleted based on the configured filters.
 
 1. Select **Delete**.

When the bulk deletion is completed, RedisInsight displays the results of this operation with the number of keys processed and the time taken to delete the keys in bulk.
Use bulk deletion to optimize the usage of your database based on the results from the Redis database analysis.
