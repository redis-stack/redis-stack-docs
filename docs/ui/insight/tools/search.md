Search for keywords and phrases within your documents stored as Redis hashes or JSON with dedicated UI controls to run search queries against a preselected index.
If you use the search capability and would like to use a dedicated UI in RedisInsight:

1. In **Browser**, open **Search by Values of Keys**.
1. Select your index.
1. Insert the search query.
1. Run the query. 

RedisInsight displays the list of keys found in the List or Tree view.

RedisInsight also provides UI controls to create a new secondary index of your data. To create such an index, specify basic index information.
