[Redis Enterprise](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/) is an enterprise-grade Redis, 
available both [on-premises](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/) and [in the cloud](https://redis.com/try-free/) (on AWS, GCP, 
or Azure). Redis Enterprise simplifies operations, scaling, and multi-tenancy, includes many integrations (e.g., K8s), and provides multiple 
tiers of support.

Read on to learn about Redis Enterprise and the benefits of its extended offerings.

## Overview

[Redis, Inc.](https://redis.com/) develops both open source and source available technologies which are free for developers to use.  These include:
* [Redis OSS](https://redis.io/download/#redis-downloads): the core engine for our software and services
* [Redis Stack](https://redis.io/download/#redis-stack-downloads) - the starting point for developers who want all the power of Redis OSS and the 
the latest and greatest innovations Redis, Inc. has to offer all in an easy to use software package.
* [Redis Enterprise](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/advantages/) - our commercial product. Redis Enterprise maintains the simplicity and 
high performance of Redis, while adding many enterprise-grade capabilities including:  

* Linear scaling to hundreds of millions of operations per second
* Improved high availability with up to 99.999% uptime
* Geo-replicated, active-active data distribution
* Data tiering
* Advanced security features
* Several deployment options (managed cloud service, software packages, K8s)
* 24/7 support

Redis Enterprise offers three deployment options: 

* Software
* Cloud
* Hybrid and Multi-cloud

### Redis Enterprise Software

[Redis Enterprise Software](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/overview/) is the on-premises distribution of Redis Enterprise. 
You download, install, and manage a Redis Enterprise Software cluster wherever you like:

* IaaS cloud environments &mdash; Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure
* Bare-metal servers in a private datacenter
* Virtual machines (VMs), Kubernetes pods, etc.

Redis provides a [Kubernetes operator](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-software/redis-enterprise-on-kubernetes/) that deploys and manages a 
Redis Enterprise cluster. You can use the operator on premises or in a private or public cloud.

The [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/gcp.redisenterprise.com?pli=1&project=redislabs-university) also offers Redis Enterprise as a Kubernetes app for easy deployment.

### Redis Enterprise Cloud

[Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/overview/) is a Database-as-a-Service provided by Redis. The fully-managed cloud 
service is based on Redis Enterprise and accessible via a self-service portal, which gives you access to the subscription/database control plane. 
Redis manages the Redis Enterprise clusters and the complexity of the underlying infrastructure.

To get started, see the [Redis Enterprise Cloud quick start](https://docs.redis.com/latest/rc/rc-quickstart/).

Let [Support](https://redis.com/company/support/) know if you have any questions.

You can also purchase and deploy Redis Enterprise Cloud directly through the cloud provider's marketplace:

* [Redis Enterprise Cloud Flexible - Pay as You Go](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-mwscixe4ujhkq) (AWS)
* [Redis Enterprise Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/endpoints/gcp.redisenterprise.com?project=redislabs-university) (GCP)
* [Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cache/#pricing) (Azure)


**Notes:**

* Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise is developed by Redis, but offered and operated by Microsoft as a first-party service within Azure.
* Redis provides second-level support to Microsoft customers.

### Hybrid and multi-cloud deployments

Redis Enterpise support both hybrid (on-premises / cloud) and multi-cloud deployments using Active-Active replication:

* Hybrid cloud with Active-Active &mdash; Combines self-managed on-prem clusters with Redis Cloud clusters
* [Multicloud with Active-Active](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise-cloud/multicloud/) &mdash; Multiple fully-managed Redis Cloud clusters with a 
geo-replicated database across multiple cloud vendors (for example, AWS and GCP)

## Build real-time apps using Redis modules

[Redis Stack](/docs/stack) extends the Redis OSS core with additional data models and capabilities such as indexing, querying, and JSON data support. 
Redis Enteprise supports all of the module extensions available as part of Redis Stack, 
see our [Stack and Enterprise docs](https://docs.redis.com/latest/modules/). 

## Redis developer tools

* [RedisInsight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) is a Redis Desktop UI for developers that can help you optimize Redis, visualize your
data, and debug your applications. RedisInsight is part of Redis Stack and can also be used with Redis OSS and Redis Enterprise. It runs cross-platform 
on Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
* [Clients and connectors](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/clients-connectors/) &mdash; Redis Enterprise is fully compatible with Redis OSS. 
Any standard Redis client can be used with Redis Enterprise.
